# MHP20ClassLib
My Goto standard C# utilities dll

I have used this DLL in most of my own custom projects over the years. 

I wrote these classes before .Net 3.0 came out.
Some classes/functions I have never used, but some I have used all the time.

These are the ones I use all the time:
DataAccess
LoggingClass
StringFuncs
ReturnClass
WebEmailClass2 - along with SimpleEmailVO

If you are looking to criticize then i really dont care - whatever floats your boat!
